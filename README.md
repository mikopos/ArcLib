# ArcLib

[Arcs are in geometry a closed segment of differentiable curve.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_(geometry)) 
In OpenLayers creating an arc might be a messy and confusing task, as there is no embedded way to do this.
ArcLib is a JS library that targets in making this task easier by wrapping all the functionality of creating arcs
in simple contructors.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine 
for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

An existing project with OpenLayers 5 support.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

Just copy the **arcLib.js** file to your preferred folder in you project

Mine for example is in  :

```
/js/arcLib.js
```

Then include the library in your html page , where you create the map with script tags

For Example: 
```
<script src="../js/arcLib.js"></script>
```

In case you want to test the library, before you use it, just **clone the whole project and
open index.html** from your browser. **In any other case just follow the above steps, as you 
don't need the rest of the files, to use the library.**

## Built With

* [JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - Scripting Language
* [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) - Used to generate the map
